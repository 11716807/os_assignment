Q.no 4: Consider a scheduling approach which is non pre-emptive similar to shortest job next in
nature. The priority of each job is dependent on its estimated run time, and also the amount of
time it has spent waiting. Jobs gain higher priority the longer they wait, which prevents
indefinite postponement. The jobs that have spent a long time waiting compete against those
estimated to have short run times. The priority can be computed as :
Priority = 1+ Waiting time / Estimated run time

Q.no 15:A uniprocessor system has n number of CPU intensive processes, each process
has its own requirement of CPU burst. The process with lowest CPU burst is given the
highest priority. A late-arriving higher priority process can preempt a currently running
process with lower priority. Simulate a scheduler that is scheduling the processes in
such a way that higher priority process is never starved due to the execution of lower
priority process. What should be its average waiting time and average turnaround time if
no two processes are arriving are arriving at same time.
